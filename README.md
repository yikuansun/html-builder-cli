## Usage
In your HTML project's directory, create a file called `manifest.json`. `manifest.json` should be a JSON file (not just a JS Object literal). It can have the following keys:
- `name` (required): the name of the application.
- `platforms` (required): an array of operating systems to build for. Each element of the array must be a string that is either `linux`, `mac`, or `windows`;
- `desc` (optional): a short description of the application.
- `version` (optional): the application's version. Must be a string in the format [`x.x.x`](https://www.akeeba.com/how-do-version-numbers-work.html). Defaults to `1.0.0`.
- `icon` (optional): the relative location of the icon file (preferably a PNG of size >= 512x512px). Defaults to `icon.png`. AN ICON FILE MUST BE PROVIDED.
- `indexFile` (optional): the relative location of the main HTML file to be displayed by the app. Defaults to `index.html`.
- `colorScheme` (optional): `dark`, `light`, or `system`. Defaults to `system`.

Here is an example `manifest.json` file:
```
{
    "name": "Cool App",
    "desc": "An awesome desktop app I made!",
    "platforms": [
        "linux",
        "mac"
    ],
    "version": "1.1.1",
    "icon": "logo.png"
}
```
Once you have finished creating your `manifest.json` file, open the command line in the same directory and run `html-builder-cli`.
